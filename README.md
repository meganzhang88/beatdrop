	Our final 426 project will implement Spotify’s API in order to create a music-centrique social media platform. In general, the website will allow users to post songs, albums, or playlists for their “friends” to rate, comment on, and/or share. Furthermore, there will be an explore page for users to discover new music that resembles their own musical taste. The website will allow users to tag artists in their posts and clicking on the tag will bring a given user to a page of strictly the artist’s songs or albums shared by other users. Not only will functionality like this allow for users to discover new artist’s musical catalogs, but it will also help artists expand their fanbase.
	In terms of functionality requirements, the website will be accessible on the world wide web and compatible with chromium-based browsers. The website relies on users to create an account that stores the history of songs that they posted as a profile page that is accessible to other users. Additionally, the user will have a profile picture and link to their Spotify account on their profile page. The purpose of the profile page is to serve as a catalog for a given user’s musical taste over time and allow for their “friends” on the website to get an idea of their general music preferences along with how other people rated/commented on the songs, albums, or playlists shared by the user. Users are able to create and delete posts whenever they please. The autocomplete widget will come in handy especially as users seek to tag artists in their posts. It will be important that the tag autocompletes in order to link all of the songs and albums to the correct artist and limit misspellings or other errors. Another intriguing element of the website is the explore page which will be dynamically crafted given a user’s activity (including rating other user’s song and album posts, posting their own songs and albums, and tagging artists). The Spotify API will be important to the project as users will be able to post their Spotify playlists, search for songs and albums they wish to post through Spotify, and possibly play snippets of songs as part of their post. Overall, we are still exploring the possibilities of the Spotify API and will surely utilize more of its given functionality as we work on the project further. 
	We strive to make the user experience very easy with a design similar to popular social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram. We will have separate tabs for the “friend” feed, explore page, profile, posting, and possible trending artist tags. In general, the website will help users discover and share music to their friends, but it will also provide another platform for new or lesser known artists to be discovered.
